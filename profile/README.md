# Welcome to Zyfer's Open Source Projects GitHub Organization ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting Zyfer's Open Source Projects (OSP) GitHub organization! Here's some information about Zyfer as an Organization.

## About me (Where it all started...)
I'm Steven, the creator behind Zyfer. At the age of 16, I embarked on this journey driven by a passion for technology and a desire to pursue what I truly love.
Having faced challenges in life, I decided to channel my energy into building applications, both online and physical devices, all while keeping them open source for fellow tech enthusiasts to explore and contribute to.
And of course do the minimal for school :)

## Contribution
Running this project entirely out of my own pocket, I rely on my own earnings and the community's support to keep things going.
You can contribute by creating extra work for me, with new issues :), as well as doing some of my work by helping solve issues.
Additionally, I'm always open to fresh project ideas within the Zyfer Organization, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions!

## Donations
If you find the information and projects here valuable and would like to support my efforts, any donation, big or small, would be greatly appreciated. 
Your generosity helps fuel the continuation of this open source initiative. Feel free to contribute via the following options:
